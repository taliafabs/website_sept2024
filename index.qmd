Hi, I'm Talia. I'm a senior at the University of Toronto, majoring in statistics and minoring in computer science & political science. I have 4.5 month old red toy/mini poodle Sophie!

I've also got a very interesting mathematical fact that I would like to share with you today!

```{r}
1 + 1 = 2
9 + 10 = 21
```
